## Code example:

This revised code utilizes ternary operators to 
condense the conditional checks for the factorial calculation, 
making the code more compact and concise.
```
public class Factorial {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 5; // Change this number to find factorial
        long result = calculateFactorial(number);
        System.out.println("Factorial of " + number + " = " + result);
    }

    public static long calculateFactorial(int n) {
        if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
            return 1;
        } else {
            return n * calculateFactorial(n - 1);
        }
    }
}
```
